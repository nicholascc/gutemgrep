# gutemgrep

well. i would like to download {all of gutenberg, some of annas archive, some of arxiv}, embed every paragraph, and run search on it for arbitrary objectives

mostly i want vector scores for everythinggg

one thing i want is like. paragraphs that maximize for certain attributes: love, pretension, vagueness, evilness, &c. just to play around with

“most erotic paragraphs on arxiv”

for books you can do scoring on every part of the book and get summary statistics. what predicts shifts toward action in novels? what is the usual sentiment arc in each genre? how does style change throughout works?

one thing i want is like. paragraphs that maximize for certain attributes: love, pretension, vagueness, evilness, &c. just to play around with

mostly for humanities, thinking project gutenberg as first application and see if we cant scale

annas archive is open—but hard to download

my friend (albert huang) did something similar to this a while ago and actually made + sold a company with it
