- When writing to .md files, & speaking to user, be very precise and concise. Accurately represent the state of your knowledge, including uncertainties.
- Read README.md.
- When creating commits, include a Co-authored-by line for me: "Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>".
- TODO: Add to this. Propose to the user when changes in workflow might be helpful, incl. changes to this AGENTS.md.
